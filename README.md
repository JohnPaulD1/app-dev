>>  Spider-Man's identity has been outed by Mysterio in "Far From Home". Peter, his aunt, and his two friends are treated like pariahs by half of the population. With the stakes held high for Peter, he goes to Doctor Strange to make everyone forget his identity with a mind-wiping spell, but it goes horribly wrong due to Peter tampering with the spell and five villains from different universes accidentally end up in the main universe including two Spider-Men who have fought their adversaries in the past. When Spider-Man's attempt to cure the villains fail, he decides to enlist help from his two counterparts to help him cure the villains so they can have a better fate. Peter will soon learn what it truly means to be Spider-Man and he will ultimately make a life-altering decision that will change his life forever.
